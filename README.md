# 100DaysofCode
This repository is a collaboration between Hawk and Zack to learn Python.

# Rules:

1. We will push our  code commits of each days to branch named "hawk" and "zack" respectively.

2. We can create N number of other branches to work on any other code/project/problems that should start with our names.

3. Main branch is protected with approve rule and we can commit in main branch with 1 approval. 
Hawk and Zack branches are protected with pull request rule, means we can crate pull request against them to merge our commits from other branch but we can not commit directly to this two branches.

Happy Learning.
